#DiceGame

This is a game that I created while brushing up on my JavaScript skills. The goal is to reach the final score before the other player. The default final score is set to 10 but can be changed at the beginning of the game by inserting a different winning score into the “Final Score” holder. Player one starts and hits the roll dice button. The number on the die is added to your current score slot and you have to click on the “Hold” button to add it to your overall. If you hit “Hold” it’s the other players turn. You have to figure out the right time to hold your current score before rolling a “1” or consecutive “6’s”. If you roll a 1 you lose your turn and anything left in the current score block and if you roll consecutive 6’s you lose you turn, all your the points in the current slot as well as all of your overall points. A new game can be started at any time by clicking the “New Game” button. After the final score is reached, hit “New Game” and the scores will be reset and you can also choose a new target score.
